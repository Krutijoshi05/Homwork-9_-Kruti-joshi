# Sum of integers

Write a program that computes the sum of the first 10 positive integers. Print the resulting sum to the screen like this: 

                            The Sum of the first 10 positive integers is: 55

Now modify your program to compute the sum of the first 100 positive integers. Print the resulting sum to the screen like this:
                           
                            The Sum of the 100 positive integers is: 5050

# Solution

The sample solution is shown in the Homework 9.py file 

                            The sum of the first 10 integers is: 55
                            The sum of the first 100 positive integers is: 5050
